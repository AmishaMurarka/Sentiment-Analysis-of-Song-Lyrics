2012,Call Me Maybe,Carly Rae Jepsen,True,"I threw a wish in the well
Don't ask me, I'll never tell
I looked to you as it fell
And now you're in my way
I trade my soul for a wish
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this
But now you're in my way
Your stare was holdin'
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're going, baby?
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me, maybe
It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me, maybe
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me, maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me, maybe
You took your time with the call
I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothing at all
But still, you're in my way
I beg and borrow and steal
At first sight, and it's real
I didn't know I would feel it
But it's in my way
Your stare was holdin'
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're going, baby?
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me, maybe
It's hard to look right at you, baby

Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me, maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me, maybe
Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad, I missed you so, so bad
Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
And you should know that
I missed you so, so bad
(Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad)
It's hard to look right at you, baby

2012,Payphone,Maroon 5 Featuring Wiz Khalifa,True,"I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone?
Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time, when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone?
Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
If ""happy ever after"" did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of it
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick, oh
You turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know I've said it before
But all of our bridges burned down
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone?

One more stupid love song, I'll be sick
Now I'm at a payphone
Ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah
Now, baby, don't hang up
So I can tell you what you need to know
Baby, I'm begging you, just please don't go
So I can tell you what you need to know
Yeah, I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone?

2012,Somebody That I Used To Know,Gotye Featuring Kimbra,True,"Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end
Always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened
And that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so rough
You didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records
And then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
And I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know...
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened
And that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so rough
You didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records
And then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Somebody

How did I read the stars so wrong?

That everything you see
Ain't always what it seems (I'm wide awake)

I wish I knew then, what I know now

2012,Lights,Ellie Goulding,True,"I had a way then losing it all on my own
I had a heart then but the queen has been overthrown
And I'm not sleeping now the dark is too hard to beat
And I'm not keeping up the strength I need to push me
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine them when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine them when I'm alone
Noises, I play within my head
Touch my own skin and hope they'll still be there
And I think back to when my brother and my sister slept
In another place the only time I feel safe
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine them when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone

I need to get my story straight
My friends are in the bathroom getting higher than the Empire State
My lover she's waiting for me just across the bar
My seat's been taken by some sunglasses asking 'bout a scar, and
I know I gave it to you months ago
I know you're trying to forget
But between the drinks and subtle things
The holes in my apologies, you know
I'm trying hard to take it back

You looked at me and I was done
We were just gettin' started
I was singin' to you, you were singin' to me

You probably wouldn't even know who I am
But if I whispered your name, I bet
Still be a spark
And back when I was gasoline
And this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didn't care what would mama think
'Bout your name on my arms
Baby, is it spring or is it summer?
The guitar sound, roll the beat of a drummer
You hear sometimes late at night
On your radio
Even though you're a million miles away
When you hear ""Born in the USA""
You relive those glory days
So long ago

Do you think about my old Jeep
Think about the stars in the sky?

On the way to rock and roll

I can hear the ringing on a beat up old guitar
Oh, I can hear em singing
Keep on dreaming

Down town is where i used to wonder
Old enough to get there but to young to get inside
So i would stand out on the sidewalk
Listen to the music playing every Friday night
Oh, I can hear em playing
I can hear the ringing of the beat of old guitar
Oh, I can hear em singing.

Even if it breaks your heart
Some dreams stay with you forever
Drag you around and bring you back to where you were
Some dreams keep on getting better
You gotta keep believing if you wanna know for sure

In that farmers field, will make a boy a man

Sat in my car
Till you turned off your porch light

And met me on the front porch
And I kissed you

Wondering what went wrong
Praying that you wouldn’t go

Without falling to your feet

You would always win, always win
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name

When I lay with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you here forever

Come around
And now I'm ruined, yeah
I'm ruined
In the evening you can catch me daydreaming
Did that moment send you reeling just like me
I should have gone over, right over
I should have never let you leave

This going and drives me crazy

2012,Fly Over States,Jason Aldean,True,"A couple guys in first class on a flight
From new York to Los Angeles,
Kinda making small talk killing time,
Flirting with the flight attendants,
Thirty thousand feet above, could be Oklahoma,
Just a bunch of square cornfields and wheat farms,
Man it all looks the same,
Miles and miles of back roads and highways,
Connecting little towns with funny names,
Who'd want to live down there in the middle of nowhere,
They've never drove through Indiana,
Met the men who plowed that earth,
Planted that seed, busted his ass for you and me,
Or caught a harvest moon in Kansas,
They'd understand why God made those fly over states,
I bet that mile long Santa Fe freight train engineer's seen it all
Just like that flatbed cowboy stacking US steel on a 3-day haul
Roads and rails under their feet
Yeah that sounds like a first class seat
On the plains of Oklahoma
Where they windshield sunset in your eyes
Like a watercolor painted sky
You'd think heaven's doors have opened
You'll understand why God made
Those fly over states
Take a ride across the badlands
Feel that freedom on your face
Breathe in all that open space
Meet a girl from Amarillo
You'll understand why God made
Why you'd want to plant your stakes
In those fly over states
Have you ever been through Indiana
On the plains of Oklahoma,

She's poppin' right out of the South Georgia water
Thought, ""Oh, good Lord, she had them long tanned legs""
Couldn't help myself so I walked up and said
Baby you're a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell lot better with you up in it

I looked at her and she looked at me
And I turned on those KC lights and drove all night
'Cause it felt so right, her and I, man we felt so right
I put it in park and
Grabbed my guitar
And strummed a couple chords
And sang from the heart

You ain't rushing for love, and I ain't up here to judge
Let's neglect the what if's and make it do what it does
Let's get it

I'm not bout to judge you, don't judge me
You ain't gotta really sing about your rap sheet

Rough sex saying I love yeah
But to kiss them saying you mean that
I know I just be calling her mean ass
Oh the irony, got the bomb indeed
But the problem is it's probably a deep past
Still I'm feeling of something I need bad
Thinking if I get her, I get her to need this
I don't need emotions to open your deep sea
I conceive an ocean by going between legs

Go, for it, couch, now
Slow, motion, around, put it down

She stay quiet, she play smart
She take pride, in going out
Getting hollered at, and saying nah
She no saint, but she don't pose
She don't wear make up by the boat load
Riding through lake shore with the nose up
She don't really date much but it slows her up
She got haters, but we all do
Heard you winter time cold, shawty fall through
Baby look at they approach how they court you
All those minds games never mind cause they all lose
In the physical sense I mean that
I ain't tryna kiss up, suck up, feed gas
I ain't like them nigga you sucking your teeth at, nope

2013,Same Love,Macklemore & Ryan Lewis Featuring Mary Lambert,True,"When I was in the 3rd grade I thought that I was gay 'cause I could draw
My uncle was and I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face, she's like
""Ben you've loved girls since before pre-K""
Trippin', yeah, I guess she had a point, didn't she?
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math like ""Yeah, I'm good a little league""
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those who like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think its a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition, playing God
Ahh nah, here we go
America the brave
Still fears what we don't know And God loves all his children it's somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written 3, 500 hundred years ago
I don't know
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
If I was gay I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the Youtube comments lately
""Man that's gay"" Gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're sayin'
Our culture founded from oppression
Yeah, we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
A word routed in hate, yet our genre still ignores it
Gay is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color the complexion of your pigment
The same fight that lead people to walk-outs and sit-ins
It's human rights for everybody
There is no difference
Live on! And be yourself!
When I was in church, they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service Those words aren't anointed
And that Holy Water, that you soak in is then poisoned
When everyone else Is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans, that have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same But that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal
Damn right I support it
I don't know
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
We press play Don't press pause
Progress, march on!
With a veil over our eyes
We turn our back on the cause
'Till the day That my uncles can be united by law
Their kids are walkin' around the hallway
Plagued by pain in their heart
A world so hateful, some would rather die than be who they are
And a certificate on paper
Isn't gonna solve it all, but it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us
We have to change us, whatever God you believe in
We come from the same one
Strip away the fear
Underneath it's all the same love
About time that we raised up
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to

Baby powder beach under my feet has got me rolling
And the breeze through crackling leaves like a daytime campfire burning
And the ship is off to sea
And the wake it is a churning
As the Southern wind sings again an island lullaby
You can jump right in
Let the music pull you in
You can jump right in
Oh and lose yourself again
As the Southern wind sings again a island lullaby
There's a place the locals go and no one knows where to find it
And the river starts to flow inside the clouds of Misty Mountain
The water from this stone below becomes a blue-green fountain
As the Southern wind sings again an island lullaby
You can jump right in
Let the music pull you in
You can jump right in
Oh and lose yourself again
As the Southern wind sings again an island lullaby
You can find me where the music meets the ocean
If you get the notion, stop on by and play a while
Simple tune to get your love light glowing
Keep your heart wide open
Disappear just like the tide
Let it roll on by
And jump right in
Let the music pull you in
You can jump right in

At this little hot mess

All over the road
Don't wanna get no ticket
Don't wanna cause no wreck

I say ""girl take it easy""
She laughs, says ""it'll be fine""
How am I supposed to keep it between the lines
Yeah I know I'm all over the road
I can't help but go

I'm trying to get her home as fast as I can go
And I know I'm all over the road

But I'll take a whole box of Cuban cigars
And I'll smoke 'em nice and slow
Like they were good for me

Sure was fun being good to you
This one we made just for fall
And winter runs a bit too small
This mint green is new for spring
My love didn't cost a thing
You're like 22 girls in one
And none of them know what they're runnin' from
Was it just too far to fall?
For a little paper doll
Fold a scarf, Moroccan red
And tie your hair behind your head
Strap into some heels that hurt
You should've kept my undershirt
You're like twenty-two girls in one
And none of them know what they're runnin' from
Was it just too far to fall?
For a little paper doll
Cut the cord and pull some strings
And make yourself some angel wings
And if those angel wings don't fly
Someone's gonna paint you another sky
'Cause you're like twenty-two girls in one
And none of them know what they're runnin' from
Was it just too far to fall?

And we've only just begun.
Think I'm gonna have a son.
He will be like she and me, as free as a dove,
Conceived in love.
Sun is gonna shine above.
And even though we ain't got money,
I'm so in love with you, honey,
And everything will bring a chain of love.
And in the morning, when I rise,
You bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything is gonna be alright.
Seems as though, a month ago, I was Beta-Chi,
Never got high.
Oh, I was a sorry guy.
And now, I smile and face the girl that shares my name.
Now I'm through with the game.
This boy will never be the same.
And even though we ain't got money,
I'm so in love with you, honey,
And everything will bring a chain of love.
And in the morning, when I rise,

Strong and kind,
And the little boy is mine.
Now I see a family where the once was none.
Now we've just begun.
Yeah, we're gonna fly to the sun.

I'm so in love with you, honey,
And everything will bring a chain of love.

You bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything is gonna be alright.
Love the girl who holds the world in a paper cup.
Drink it up.
Love her and she'll bring you luck.
And if you find she helps your mind, better take her home.
Don't you live alone.
Try to earn what lovers own.

They would let us in on a laid back kind of style

I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore

They wanna stroll on a city sidewalk
I got a dress that 'll show a little uh uh

All alone just the beat inside my soul
Take me home where my dreams are made of gold
In the zone where the beat is uncontrolled
I know what it feels like
Come on, make me feel alive!
Feel alive...
Meet me under shining lights
I've been waiting right here all my life
Feelings you can't deny that you're living
Open up your eyes
And I just wanna sink into your crazy laughter
Come on make me feel until the pain don't matter
Every second here makes my heart beat faster
Finally think I found what I'm chasing after
All alone just the beat inside my soul
Take me home where my dreams are made of gold

2014,Play It Again,Luke Bryan,True,"She was sittin' all alone over on the tailgate
Tan legs swingin' by a Georgia plate
I was lookin' for her boyfriend
Thinkin', ""No way she ain't got one""
Soon as I sat down I was fallin' in love
Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off
She was like, ""Oh, my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round, waitin' for it to come on and here it is""
She was like, ""Come here boy, I wanna dance""
'Fore I said a word she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' me around 'til it faded out
And she gave me a kiss
And she said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""
And I said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""
I'd a gave that DJ my last dime
If he would have played it just one more time
But a little while later we were sittin' in the drive in my truck
Before I walked her to the door
I was scannin' like a fool AM, FM, XM, too
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove
Man, you should have seen her light up
She was like, ""Oh, my God, this is my song
We've been listenin' to the radio all night long
I can't believe that it came back on, but here it is""
She was like, ""Come here boy, I wanna dance""
'Fore I said a word she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
And I said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""
And she said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""
The next Friday night
We were sittin' out under the stars
You should have seen her smile
When I broke out my guitar
She was like, ""Oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round, waitin' for it to come on and here it is""

Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like I'm the queen
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I've tried
Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Well, now they know
Let it go, let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn away and slam the door
I don't care what they're going to say
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway
It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all
It's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
I'm free
Let it go, let it go
I am one with the wind and sky
Let it go, let it go
You'll never see me cry
Here I stand and here I stay
Let the storm rage on
My power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
I'm never going back, the past is in the past
Let it go, let it go
When I'll rise like the break of dawn
Let it go, let it go

'Cause I taped your picture to the seatback right beside me
Now I've got empty mini bottles fillin' both our trays

Buyin' drinks for everybody

Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention

I'm up so high, may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain

I'd go shoot tequila, take a lime and suck it
And we'd tell our bosses they can do the same
We'll find a big cruise ship and buy the whole dang thing
We'd sail around the world and go to shore in a dingy

2014,Don't,Ed Sheeran,True,"I met this girl late last year
She said, ""Don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her, ""I'm not really looking for another mistake""
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets 'til the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then should have just said, she's singing
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe
And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before, a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe
On my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next (you bastard)
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat (you bastard)
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realized what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singing
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold

Tearin' down an almost two lane back road
Freedom and fireflies in the air

Stayin' on the gas like we're never comin' back

Crew at my house and we party every weekend so
On the radio, that's my favorite song
Made me bounce around, like I don't know, like I won't be here long
Now the thrill is gone
Got no patience, 'cause I'm not a doctor
Girl why is you lying? Girl why you Mufasa?
Yeah, mi casa su casa, gotta strip it like Gaza
Got so high off volcanoes, now the flow is so lava
Yeah, we spit that saliva, iPhone got message from Viber
Either the head is so hydra, or we let bygones be bygones

But now I care more
Man nobody out here's got it figured out
So therefore, I've lost all hope of a happy ending

We spend it, with no shame
We blow that, like Coltrane
We in here, like Rogaine
Or leave it, like Cobain

Got a Lambo like Lebron's mom

Can't tell
'Cause when them checks clear, they're not here
'Cause they don't care

Let me take y'all back man
As I do so well
Wasn't nothin' like that
Man, it wasn't nothin' like that first time
She was in my math class
Long hair, brown skin with the fat ass
Sat beside me, used to laugh at mad jokes
The teacher always got mad so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it
I was a youngin' straight crushin' tryna play this shit cool
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school
'Cause when I seen 'em thighs on her and them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreaming, man what
I'm thinkin' how she ride on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it
It make it hard for me to stand up
As time goes by, attractions getting deeper
Wet dreaming thinkin' that I'm smashin' but I'm sleepin'
I want it bad, and I ain't never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said ""have you ever had sex before""

I said I was like a pro baby
Knowing I was stuntin'
But if I told the truth I knew I'd get played out son
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one
But, she don't know what
So she done roll back and told me
""Oh you a pro homie? Well I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday baby we can get to freakin'""
That's when my heart start racing and my body start sweatin'
Baby you done woke my lil' man up
I'm thinkin' how that body look naked when playing on the bed
Teacher please don't make me stand up
I wrote back like ""Yeah baby sound like a plan""
Still trying to play it cool, sound like the man

Practice putting condoms on, how it go right
I'm in a crib now a nigga palm sweatin'
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection

And a nigga roll over on top
And then she get my pants unbuckled and her hands start rubbing
On me, ooh girl don't stop

Pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah just how I practice

It's not your fault they try get me, cause I'ma need the sales
Cause I'm selfish, and I need you to myself

Wrong, how dare I say ignore them
Preparing for that day, I leave you here and switch you for them

Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
Once I was seven years old
It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By 11 smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure
Once I was 11 years old, my daddy told me
Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely
Once I was 11 years old
I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about the glory, just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me
Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once I was 20 years old
(Lukas Graham)
I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me atleast those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later
Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
I was writing 'bout everything, I saw before me
Once I was 20 years old
Soon we'll be 30 years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon we'll be 30 years old
I'm still learning about life
My woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs
And I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me
Some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind
My brother I'm still sorry
Soon I'll be 60 years old, my daddy got 61
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made the man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit, once or twice a month
Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me
Soon I'll be 60 years old
Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can hold me
Soon I'll be 60 years old

Told me he wanted to talk for a while

Together, we will fly away in a cloud of green
To your beautiful destiny
As we soared above the town that never loved me
I realized I finally had a family
Soon enough, we reached Neverland
Peacefully, my feet hit the sand
And ever since that day
I am a Lost Boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored, we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook
""Run, run, Lost Boy"", they say to me
""Away from all of reality""

And Lost Boys like me are free

A million up but still ain't never touch my rap money
I'm out in LA fuckin' with that boy OT
Flew to LA, got a plug on that OG
You know I've been gettin' money if you know me
When I first met my plug, I told him I piss a hundred Gs
I ain't comin' to get it unless you got a hundred piece
I don't want it, fuck it, your price, you need to cut it
Your ice, you need to tuck it, she fuck with me, she lucky
A half a million, all 20s in that Gucci luggage

Young nigga playin' with commas, might go get a Lamb for the summer
I've been outchea in these streets all my life hustlin'

Put some Forgis on my old school and I had to gut it

Take her phone disconnecting her cellular
What you need that for undressing
What you need that for caressing her
Spreading her legs 'bout to pleasure her
Pulling her hair from the back
Go to pressing her
Trying to see who tap first made a bet with her

She catching feelings she say we inseparable

Was all that wasted time

And the rope by the river hangs silently
And the town that I knew ain't nothing like it used to be

And the days got sold to the greed and the game

2016,The Sound Of Silence,Disturbed,True,"Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence
In restless dreams, I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence
And in the naked light, I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared
And no one dared
Disturb the sound of silence
""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words, like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
Then the sign said, ""The words on the prophets are written on the subway walls
In tenement halls""
And whispered in the sound of silence",2015,"Metal, Orchestral pop"

I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long
I know I've grown, but I can't wait to go home

Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and
Getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night
I don't reckon that I did it right, but
I was younger then, take me back to when
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long
Oh, how we've grown, but I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes

One works down by the coast
One had two kids, but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife

And I'm on my way

Lookin' for a problem with my young goblins
I'ma send a model home with her neck throbbin'
I done made so much money that it's non-stoppin'
Got my brothers on my back like the last name
I remember tellin' everyone I couldn't be tamed
Woah, six months later I had snapped and now I'm in the game
Went from fake chains to diamonds in another lane
Went from ""Can you take me here?"" to skrrting out the lane
Went from ""Damn this nigga lame"" to remember my name
So I remember all the people who ain't fucked with me
They went to college, now all them niggas is history
Upgraded from gold to diamonds in my teeth
Riding deep in the van, like we lookin' for a mystery (Raggy!)
So don't fuck with me
No, lately I been livin' like luxury
Boat and Kyle stick together like piano keys
And on my mother's mother I won't fuck a bitch without a damn rubber
I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind

Maybe we have made her blind

Forgiveness' a sin in your undying love
Every twist every turn for the way you made sure
All my roads led to her
So tonight I will fall down on my knees
'Cause Lord knows how lucky I am
I'm gonna shout at the top of my lungs
Thank God for this woman, Amen

I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin' 'em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I'm back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick
I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain't poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now

When I heard all that time that they gave to Taleeb
He got a life sentence plus
We just some products of our environment
How the fuck they gon' blame us?
You can't fight fire with fire
I know, but at least we can turn up the flames some
Every colored person ain't dumb and all whites not racist
I be judging by the mind and heart, I ain't really into faces
Fucked up, the way that we livin' is not getting better
You gotta know how to survive
Crazy, I had to tell all of my loved ones
To carry a gun when they going outside
Stare in the mirror whenever you drive
Overprotective, go crazy for mine
You gotta pay attention to the signs
Seem like the blind following the blind
Thinking 'bout everything that's going on
I boost security up at my home
I'm with my kind if they right or they wrong
I call him now, he'll pick up the phone
And it's five in the morning, he waking up on it
Tell 'em wherever I'm at, then they comin'
I see blue lights, I get scared and start runnin'
That shit be crazy, they 'posed to protect us
Throw us in handcuffs and arrest us
While they go home at night, that shit messed up
Knowing we needed help, they neglect us
Wondering who gon' make them respect us
I can see in your eye that you fed up
Fuck around, got my shot, I won't let up
They know that we a problem together
They know that we can storm any weather
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear
Fuck it, I'm goin' on the front line
He gon' bust your ass if you come past that gun line
You know when the storm go away, then the sun shine
You gotta put your head in the game when it's crunch time
I want all my sons to grow up to be monsters
I want all my daughters to show out in public
Seems like we losing our country
But we gotta stand up for something, so this what it comes to
Every video I see on my conscience
I got power, now I gotta say somethin'
Corrupted police been the problem where I'm from
But I'd be lying if I said it was all of them
I ain't do this for the trend, I don't follow them
Altercations with the law, had a lot of them
People speaking for the people, I'm proud of them
Stick together, we can get it up out of them
I can't lie like I don't rap about killing and dope
But I'm telling my youngins to vote
I did what I did 'cause I didn't have no choice or no hope
I was forced to just jump in and go
This bullshit is all that we know, but it's time for a change
Got time to be serious, no time for no games
We ain't takin' no more, let us go from them chains
God bless they souls, every one of them names
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear
They trainin' officers to kill us
Then shootin' protestors with these rubber bullets
They regular people, I know that they feel it
These scars too deep to heal us
What happened to COVID? Nobody remember
It ain't makin' sense, I'm just here to vent
It happen to one of your people, it's different
We get it, the system is wicked, just learn how to pick it
Knowledge is power, I swear I'm a witness, I know that I'm gifted
I won't go too deep 'cause I'm scared they'll get me
Ain't scared to admit it, some shit I can't mention
It's people who can, well, here's the chance
I won't take the stand, but I'll take a stand for what I believe
Must not be breathing the air that I breathe
You know that the way that I bleed, you can bleed
I never been a fan of police
But my neighborhood know I try to keep peace
So it's only right that I get in the streets
March for a reason, not just on GP
Our people died for us to be free
Fuck do you mean? This was a dream
Now we got the power that we need to have
They don't want us with it and that's why they mad, yeah

Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you, like those goodbye taillights
Heading west to anywhere out of this no where town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
Hell, I'm laying every night holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you
You always used to talk about L.A
I heard you got as far as Santa Fe
Oh wait, you know I tried to track you down
I only got as far as guitar town
Singing about a girl I used to know, used to know better

I would say it's more effective to treat people like children
Understandin' the time and love and patience that's needed to grow
This change is inevitable but ain't none of us seen this before
Therefore we just gotta learn everything as we go
I struggle with thoughts on the daily
Feel like a slave that somehow done saved enough coins to buy his way up outta slavery
Thinkin' just maybe, in my pursuit to make life so much better for me and my babies
I done betrayed the very same people that look at me like I'm some kind of a hero
Because of the zeros that's next to the commas
But look here, I promise I'm not who you think
Ran into this nigga outside of the store yesterday
He said something that had me like, ""Wait""
He was like ""Cole, 'preciate what you been doin', my nigga, that's real""
But damn, why I feel faker than Snow on Tha Bluff?
Well maybe 'cause deep down I know I ain't doing enough
The sun is shinin' today
The sun is shinin' today
The sun is shinin' today
Can you walk with me?
I hope we'll find the reason why we often sob, go on cry
Painful memories fuck up the vibe
Though I be tryna let the time heal my mind
I was once a child, I've gotten older
Still, I know I'm just a boy in God's eyes

Plus endurance to survive, help mine thrive",2020,"Alternative/Indie, Pop, Singer-Songwriter"
2020,After A Few,Travis Denning,True,"I probably shouldn't have said hello
When I saw you out with your friends
I know I should've left it alone
When I caught you looking
A little smile, a little how you been
A little touch, a little reminisce
It always starts off innocent
But after a few drinks
It's always the same thing
We find ourselves lost in conversation at the bar
Then after a few songs
The kind that you hold on
We find ourselves leaning up against my car
Shoulda stopped at one
Said goodbye, given up at two
If we didn't wanna wind up falling into my bed like we always do
After a few
Oh, after a few
We always take it way too far
Where it's too much to resist
We always make it way too hard
To walk away after that third kiss

From all the sunlight of our past

Does she mean you forgot about me?

So find someone great, but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier
And do you tell her she's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen?
An eternal love bullshit you know you'll never mean
Remember when I believed you meant it when you said it first to me?
And now I'm pickin' her apart
Like cuttin' her down will make you miss my wretched heart
But she's beautiful, she looks kind
She probably gives you butterflies
I hope you're happy

I'm tired of gettin' drunk, tired of bein' free
Tired of seein' pictures I don't wanna see
Girl, you're everywhere, everywhere but behind me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s
Back then, I could've convinced myself that maybe you called when I was out
And you didn't know what to say, so you didn't leave a message
And that you're probably at home right now, sound asleep
'Cause goin' out isn't really your thing
And I wouldn't have a clue what you've been up to lately
Or who you've been up to it with
But when I don't miss your calls, I miss you callin'

Guess I didn't make the time
And it's been a year since I've seen a deer
Had a smallmouth on the line
The other day I hooked a monster
And as I reeled him in
I thought, ""Man, it feels good to be country again""
Huh
I spent way less time in Nashville
And more time in L.A.
My back home buddies, they quit callin'
Thought I had too much on my plate
But last night we cracked some cold beers
And cranked Eric Church to ten
Thought, ""Man, it feels good to be country again""
Yeah, I love me some California
But it sure ain't Tennessee
And my roots down there in Georgia
Yeah, they started missin' me
And I wouldn't change the things I've done
Or the places that I've been
Man, it feels good to be country again
I traded in my Silverado
Didn't need no four by four
Tucked my boots in the back of the closet
They didn't feel like me no more
But I dug 'em out and slipped 'em on
They've been on my feet since then
Man, it feels good to be country again
Oh
Yeah, I love me some California
But it sure ain't Tennessee
And my roots down there in Georgia
Yeah, they started missin' me
And I wouldn't change the things I've done
Or the places that I've been
Man, it feels good to be country again
I traded sunsets with my wife
For hours on my phone
And even when I was right beside her
I still wasn't really home
But last night we built a fire
Watched the moonlight kiss her skin

If I firm the ting and work that, can you take it anymore?
This time I have left cannot be wasted anymore
You realize it now and you miss it
Texts go green, it hits a little different, don't it?
Know you miss the days when I was grippin' on it
Know you're in the house tonight just thinkin' on it
I moved on so long ago
I moved on so long ago
You're still thinkin' 'bout me, though, oh
I'm still tryna make sense of it all
You're still sayin' things to keep me involved
Supposed to let me know how you feel, now what to do?
It shouldn't take a text from me to speak your truth
Rough
You're dealing with me rough
I know you like it rough
But this might be too much
You're dealing with me rough
I know you like it rough
But this might be too much

Well, don't wanna make something from nothing, that's where I be
Well, keep getting nothing for something, how's that fair to me?
I'm thinking something for something, that's what I need
I'm too behind in a race to rush for my lead
I'm not rushing you, trust me, I'm
I'm the last person that needs to rush anything, wait
I feel like everything these days leads to nothing, wait
I feel like everything these days leads to nothing
It's clear that we all get lonely, then you call me
All I needed from you was to
Hold me down when things aren't working
For some reason, I believed in you, oh

Know you miss the days when I was grippin' on it
Know you're in the house tonight just thinkin' on it
I moved on so long ago
So long ago
I can't even remember when we lost each other
Was it last year, this year, or some other?
Been so long since you said things that cover up the lies
We can do it this time
Just have some faith, we can do it this time
Your favorite thing to say, ""We can do it this time""
Just have some faith, we can do it this time

How can I lose when we the who's who's?
Still runnin' 'round with mohawk
Jet ready, pack the Goyard
People probably think I show off
I ain't even give it yet
Runnin' up a silly check, stayin' off the internet
Share the stage with Billie Eilish
Turnt at any given time
Personal partners pillow talkin'
Because I got rich without 'em
Only thing they should be sayin' is
""Baby keep it solid""
We ain't even deep as we used to be
This shit slick, divided

I bring the freak up out her
Can't play with me, you know I come trim
I'm in a different league

What you gon' do for me?
Forty-thousand miles up in the air
Only time I get some Z's
Full-court press, foot on they neck
And I can't let 'em breathe
Blood, sweat, and tears come with this check
It ain't nowhere near easy
Had to fall back, you know how that go
We only speakin' briefly
Hope I'm not too much to handle

Could've put down on another Lambo

Living like a don
Might smoke a blunt in the back of the Maybach
Pull up like your mama with the switch
Why the fuck would you say that?
You can do it first
I'ma do it worst, gotta double the pay back
Never take it personal, show no mercy
Bruh taught me that way back
Condo to get off, I was always taught

Never be a bother, if you off me
No problem, just say that
Never runnin' off, so if I owe you
I got you, I'll pay that
Give this shit my all, so when I'm old

You was the nigga who doubted me
I was too mad at you
You let 'em come kill you, my brother
That shit was a tragedy
But magically I got the strategy
I was so sick and tired of niggas keep askin' me
""Who was the killers between the hood?"" (DJ on the beat so it's a banger)
Bro I'm a king, that mean we good
Talked to my TT about my problems
Learned to survive, I carry my choppa
Before I was 12, I went to the doctor
Fucked on a stripper and I took me a Roxy
How you my blooda? You say you gon' pop me
Fall over loyalty, never 'bout thotties
Don't mention my name if you mention them bodies
Don't mention my name if you mention them bodies
""Stop takin' drugs after sendin' a song""
How you gon' blame me? I give her cabaña
Bitch I'm a star, gotta use condom
Don't drink Par, only like Wocka
Sippin' on Wocka, I feel like I'm Flocka
Shit in my pocket, that shit'll go blocka
Say that I'm mean, what you mean? I caught you
Get away from her, high speed, I'm toxic
Called you a bitch, I'm sorry I lost it
Head down, X pill, Percocet, off it
Bitch my phone died, pass me a charger
Ain't have a coat, walked to school in a thermal
Bitches you lookin' up to, they'll burn you
Get out my business, this shit don't concern you
I get to diggin' this shit when I learn you
I love the trenches, this shit is eternal
Oh my God, what happened to Virgil?
I wish my brother had made it out surgery
I be up thinkin', that shit do be hurtin' me
If they gon' catch me, them niggas gon' murder me (oh no, oh)
Gave my bro twenty, he caught for a burglary
I love the bitches who say they ain't heard of me
Never seen blood, that shit'll turn burgundy
Oh my God, what happened to Virgil?
Oh my God, what happened to Virgil?
Fresh like the first day of school, I'm a scholar
Found the solution and got some more problems
We from the sandbox, my dog since a toddler
Sixteen year old when I shot my first chopper
Flew out of Van Nuys, landed in Opa Locka
Quit flyin' the G5, fly helicopters (fly helicopters)
I count every blessin' and count every dollar
I'm 'bout to go factory plain
I treat all of my dogs the same
Take care all of my bitches the same
I just hope you financially sane
Never turnin' my back on the gang
From the A, we was taught to be brave
Had to squabble and take a few fades
Stay rock solid, you'll get through the phase
That my nigga, what happened to Virgil?
Talked to God, I don't wanna get murdered
I got style, I don't know what you heard of
You lil' pussy, you soft and fertile
Only rumors throughout my circle
Only rumors throughout my circle, oh
R.I.P. Prince, I'ma pour up some purple
600 Maybach, the one with the curtain
Young GunnaWunna, the boy bought the Birkin
I'm goin' hard, now you proud of me workin'

Hold it down, do this shit with a purpose

For kickin' up dust in a tail light glow
Dry wood makes good fires
Goodyears make good swings
All that's all good but for me

Loves Tim McGraw and a small town accent
Ain't no way that me and this truck made her fall in love
Jack makes good whiskey but God makes the good stuff
Oh, God makes the good stuff
Like that sweet little kiss she lays on me
When I pull up in the gravel drive
The way she dances with the raindrops
Like she's the reason why they fall from the sky
And I thank Him every time I close my eyes
God makes five foot nine, brown eyes, and a sundress
Loves Tim McGraw and a small town accent
Ain't no way that me and this truck made her fall in love
Jack makes good whiskey but God makes the good stuff
God made her so I will make sure
He didn't waste an angel on me

Ain't no way that me and this truck made her fall in love

All I wanna be
Ooh (ooh)
(Ooh)
She's all I wanna be so bad
(Ooh)
Oh (ooh)
Stupid boy makin' me so sad
Didn't think it would hurt this bad
She's got everything that I don't have
How could I ever compete with that?
I know you'll go and change your mind
One day wake up and be bored with mine
She's got everything that I don't have
And she's all I wanna be
All I wanna be so bad
All I wanna be so bad
She's got everything that I don't have
And she's all I wanna be
All I wanna be so bad",2022,"R&B/Soul, Pop"

Que la quiero volver a ver
Y volverla a besar
Yo te paso a buscar, buscar
Es que la bellaquera contigo
Con nadie más la consigo
De tus grito' hoy no me olvido
Te-te-tengo reservao' el hotel
Pero con estas gana' no vamo' a llegar
Somo' do' desesperado', por eso nos tuvimo' que parquear
Atrá' nos espera el asiento
Tú ere' una aventura cuando te desnuda'
Te-te-tengo reservao' el hotel
Pero con estas gana' no vamo' a llegar
Somo' do' desesperado', por eso nos tuvimo' que parquear
Atrá' nos espera el asiento
Tú ere' una aventura cuando te desnuda'
La' gana' de tenerla, yo no pude, tuve
Que hacértelo cuando me detuve, sudé
En la parte 'e atrá', aunque falta comodidad
Tus grito' confirmaron que viste la' nube'
La bellaquera nos domina siempre que tú y yo no' vemo'
No importa el ambiente, donde sea no' comemo'
No hay planificación porque a ti la situación
Te descontrola y no hay forma de evitar la situación
Donde siempre terminamos sin ropa
No te conformas con un beso en la boca
Según tú dice', yo soy el que te provoca
Pero me busca' aunque sabe' que tengo a otra
Te-te-tengo reservado el hotel
Pero con estas gana' no vamo' a llegar
Somo' do' desesperados, por eso nos tuvimos que marchar
Atrás nos espera el asiento
Tú ere' una aventura cuando te desnuda'
La primera vez que perreamos
No pudimo' evitarlo y nos besamos (ey)
Que el momento no acabara no dejamo'
En vano no fue, la toqué como un piano
Tu mirada me dijo que esto hoy gano (yah)
Ah
Mami, ¿tú quiere' más
Tú quiere' más, tú quiere' más? (Uh-wh)
Bebé, pues no se hable más (y-yih)
No me suelte' y vámono' de una ve' (yah)
Bendeci'o por ser el que ve tu desnudez (amén)
Lo más que me gusta 'e ti e' tu sencillez
Le gusta agresivo, pero que entre con delicadez
De la Metro a Mayagüez (Ra-Rauw)
¿Qué me dice usted?
Que la quiero volver a ver
Y volverla a besar
