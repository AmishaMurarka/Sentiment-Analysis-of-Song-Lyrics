# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Song-Lyrics

## Problem Statement
Music is a powerful language to express our feelings and in many cases is used as a therapy to deal with tough moments in our lives or 
as a tool to celebrate the joyous moments. The different sounds, rhythms, and effects used in music are capable to modify our emotions for a moment,
